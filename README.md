## Hi Everyone <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Smilies/Dotted%20Line%20Face.png" alt="Dotted Line Face" width="22" height="22" />

My name is Prakhar Sinha. I am an aspiring software developer! I recently graduated from UC Davis and I'm working as an AI/ML engineer at HuLoop Automation. A little bit about myself is that I love nature, traveling and going on hikes! However, when I'm inside, you can find me either reading a book, playing a video game or drawing. When it comes to CS, I have three key areas of focus.

## 🤖 **AI/ML: AI Infrastructure, Computer Vision, LLMs, Voice AI, and eXplainable AI (XAI)** 
There are all of my projects in AI/ML. A huge interest of mine right now is AI Infrastructure, I don't have any projects publically but it's my main area of interest at HuLoop Automation. 
- (**Voice AI, LLMs**) [_prakhar-agent: a RAG-Enabled Voice Agent_](https://github.com/prakhargaming/AI-RAG-Voice-Agent)
  
  A RAG-Enabled AI voice agent built on _LiveKit_, _Deepgram_, _Cartesia_, _Gemini_, and _LlamaIndex_.
- (**Computer Vision**) [_SimCLR for Fast Learning_](https://github.com/prakhargaming/SimCLR_for_Fast_Learning)
  
  SimCLR for Fast Learning is a fine-tuned version of the original PyTorch SimCLR: A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations model trained on the firefighting device detection dataset on Roboflow.
- (**LLMs**) [GenAI Powered Smart Categorization Engine](https://github.com/prakhargaming/GenAI_Catagorization_Engine)
  
  An that outputs the search results that are actually relevant to the product title and description using GenAI and natural language processing (NLP).
- (**Computer Vision**) [_FastSAM for Needle Biopsy_](https://github.com/prakhargaming/FastSAM-needle-biopsy)
  
  For UC Davis Health and Dr. Fereidouni's lab. I'm using the FastSAM model (originally developed by Meta Research) to develop an automated imaging processing pipeline for the [GigaFIBI microscope](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=Microscopy-2024-MS1A.2).
- (**XAI, Computer Vision**) [_XAI ResNet-50 Data Visualization Web Development Project_](https://github.com/prakhargaming/Data-Visualization-Web-Dev-Project)
  
  My task with this project was to visualize the second to last layer of the ResNet-50 machine-learning model to help us better understand why the model came to the designs it did.

## 🕸 **Full-Stack Web Development** 
I used to fear front-end development but now over half my commit history has to do with TypeScript 😨. I've grown to like it quite a bit! These days I'm usually working with NextJS, TypeScript and Tailwind.
- [_prakhargaming.com_](https://github.com/prakhargaming/prakhar-website) prakhargaming.com is my fully responsive and modern personal website that also serves as my portfolio. It started off as a dumb exercise in front-end development but it has evolved into a space that I use to test out and demonstrate my skills as a developer. It has a ton of moving parts:
  - MongoDB Atlas Database
  - Authentication with Clerk
  - Twilio Send-Grid for Automated Emails
  - Google Gemini API for LLM functionality
  
## 🧠 **Brain-Computer Interfaces** 
This was my labor of love in college. I was the co-head of the Neurotech@Davis projects division for 2 years. I will always look fondly on my days developing brain computer interfaces in the future and I hope to one day go back to them in the industry.
- [_Neuro-Prosthetic EEG Controlled Robotic Arm_](https://github.com/Neurotech-Davis/RoboticArm)

  I think this is the coolest thing I've ever made. This project used the mental imagery of a real person to move a prosthetic arm.
- [_Chrome No Internet Game Using EEG_](https://github.com/Neurotech-Davis/Neurofest-Project-2023)

  This was one of my first BCI projects. It used EEG signals to control the dinosaur in the famous chrome no-internet game.
