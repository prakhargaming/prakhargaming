## Hi Everyone üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My name is Prakhar Sinha. I am an aspiring software developer! I recently graduated from UC Davis and am looking to break into the software industry. A little bit about myself is that I love nature, traveling and going on hikes! However, when I'm inside, you can find me either reading a book, playing a video game or drawing. When it comes to CS, I have three key areas of focus.

## ü§ñ **AI/Computer Vision** 
I really like messing around with AI Models! I have a lot of experience here. My main area of interest in the field is **eXplainable AI (XAI)** and **Computer Vision**. Refer to these projects if you'd like to see what I've done in these areas!
- [FastSAM for Needle Biopsy:](https://github.com/prakhargaming/FastSAM-needle-biopsy) This is what I'm currently working on for UC Davis Health and Dr. Fereidouni's lab. I'm using the FastSAM model (originally developed by Meta Research) to develop an automated imaging processing pipeline for the [GigaFIBI microscope](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=Microscopy-2024-MS1A.2).
- [XAI ResNet-50 Data Visualization Web Development Project:](https://github.com/prakhargaming/Data-Visualization-Web-Dev-Project) My task with this project was to visualize the second to last layer of the ResNet-50 machine-learning model to help us better understand why the model came to the designs it did.

## üï∏ **Front End** 
I used to fear front-end development but now over half my commit history has to do with TypeScript üò®. I've grown to like it quite a bit! These days I'm usually working with NextJS, TypeScript and Tailwind.
- [Scripta Welcome Page:](https://github.com/prakhargaming/scripta-welcome-interface) This is what I'm currently working on as well! This is being developed for the company I intern at, VDart. I think it showcases my front-end skills the best. This web app prompts the user to record audio, works with AWS and DigitalOcean to send and receive data, uses Firebase for authentication and contains some of my most sophisticated front-end code to date.
- [Scripta Dashboard:](https://github.com/prakhargaming/scripta-dashboard) This repo follows the same story as the previous one. Cool things about this web app is that it uses TailwindUI for stylization (so it looks really nice), Firebase for authentication and dynamically renders tables with data from DigitalOcean.
  
## üß† **Brain-Computer Interfaces** 
This was my labor of love in college. I was the co-head of the Neurotech@Davis projects division for 2 years. I will always look fondly on my days developing brain computer interfaces in the future and I hope to one day go back to them in the industry.
- [Neuro-Prosthetic EEG Controlled Robotic Arm:](https://github.com/Neurotech-Davis/RoboticArm) I think this is the coolest thing I've ever made. This project used the mental imagery of a real person to move a prosthetic arm.
- [Chrome No Internet Game Using EEG](https://github.com/Neurotech-Davis/Neurofest-Project-2023) This was one of my first BCI projects. It used EEG signals to control the dinosaur in the famous chrome no-internet game.
